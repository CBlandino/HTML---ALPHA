    <h1>About ALPHA</h1>
    <p>Welcome to ALPHA, your destination for affordable and high-quality clothing that stands the test of time. Here's a little bit about us:</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission at ALPHA is to provide easily identifiable clothing made from sustainable materials. We believe in offering affordable options without compromising on quality.</p>
    <h2>Our Commitment to Quality</h2>
    <p>Unlike many brands that prioritize cost-cutting, we prioritize quality and sustainability. Our clothing is made from organic cotton, hemp, linen, tencel, and peace silk, making them more breathable, softer, and environmentally friendly.</p>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a group of college students who are passionate about raising the standard for clothing. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a brand that offers reliable clothing made from sustainable materials.</p>
